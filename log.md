# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday 23rd April, 2025
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started the replit 100-days of code challenge for Python. I learnt about print statements, CMD + Enter (shortcut to run code), triple quotes to extend strings across lines within code, what name errors and syntax errors are. Name errors occur if you get the name of a function wrong, mispell it or get the capitalization wrong. Syntax errors occur if your order of symbols is wrong or you forget puncutation, such as brackets or quotation marks. Figuring out why errors occur and fixing them is called 'debugging'

**Thoughts:** Thursday 24th April, 2025 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 2: February 24, 2025 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about the input command (taking using input), where the user gives information to the computer. This is done through the input function.

- You can store data from inputs into variables. Variable names cannot contain spaces, but can contain underscores between words or camelCaseToMakeItEasierToRead. The basic syntax for assigning a value to a variable is the variable name followed by the assignment operator (=) 

    For example, to assign the value of 5 to the variable of x, you would use this code:
      x = 5

- Not too surprisingly, you can print the value stored in a variable by using print(variableName).

The code below uses inputs, variables and the print function
   ```python
userName = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello, " + userName + "!")
favFood = input("What's your favorite food?")
print("I like " + favFood + " too!")
```


**Thoughts**: Rather simple so far. It would be good to build more complicated projects. But perhaps this will start soon during the Replit challenge.

### Day 3: Friday April 25th, 2025

**Today's Progress**: The len function is a way to check the number of characters within a string.

 ```python
myName = ("Monica")
print(myName)
print (len(myName))
```
The output to the above would be 6.

+ Concatination (this means to add something to the end). So, you could add either numbers or strings together:

          ```python
        firstName = ("Monica")
        middleName = ('Tara')
        lastName = ('Dave')
        
        fullName = (firstName + " " + middleName + " " + lastName)
        print(fullName)
        ```
The output to the above would be 'Monica Tara Dave'

+ An expression is made of operators and operands (the thing that is operated on). Operators are mathmatetical. Operands can be strings or numbers. 

+ The modular (%) operator divides the first number by the second, then counts any remainders left over. This is a great way to check whether a value is even or odd. If the result is a 1, then this remainder indicates an odd number, and and even number if the result is 0.

     ```python
     if (15 % 2 == 0):
        print ("The result is even")
    else: 
        print ("The result is odd")
        ```
The result of the above code would be "The result is odd"

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
