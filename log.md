# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 23, 2025
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started the replit 100-days of code challenge for Python. I learnt about print statements, CMD + Enter (shortcut to run code), triple quotes to extend strings across lines within code, what name errors and syntax errors are. Name errors occur if you get the name of a function wrong, mispell it or get the capitalization wrong. Syntax errors occur if your order of symbols is wrong or you forget puncutation, such as brackets or quotation marks. Figuring out why errors occur and fixing them is called 'debugging'

**Thoughts:** Feeling confident so far.

### Day 2: February 24, 2025 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
